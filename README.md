## About the Service
This is a project from the Yandex backend school.

The application is a multithreaded REST API service that allows you to save and retrieve information about couriers and orders.

The server allows you to add order completion information.

You can also get information about couriers' ratings and earnings.

_Distribution of orders by couriers has not **yet** been implemented._

A bucket4j rate limiter with a limit of 10 RPS is used for each endpoint.

Postgresql 15.2 database is used to store data. You can also use any other relational database.
